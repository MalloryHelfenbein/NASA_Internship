# NASA_Internship
Code from my NASA internship summer 2023 

This repo contains the notebook used in order to find the specific expertise of published authors. The notebook contains all of the necessary functions as well as the steps listed out and what each aspect of the notebook means. Along with the notebook, this repo also contains the necessary stopwords and TextAnalysis files that are used in the functions in the notebook. In order to properly use the notebook, these accompanying files need to be downloaded as well.
